## Counter

This is a simple counter implemented in React. It consists of three buttons: one for incrementing the counter, one for decrementing it, and one for resetting it to zero.

### Usage

To use the counter, simply click on the buttons:

- The **Increment** button will increase the counter by one.
- The **Decrement** button will decrease the counter by one.
- The **Reset** button will set the counter back to zero.

You can keep track of the current value of the counter as you interact with the buttons.

#### Example:

Counter Value: 0

| Action | Counter Value |
| ------ | ------------- |
| Increment | 1 |
| Increment | 2 |
| Decrement | 1 |
| Reset | 0 |

Feel free to play around with the counter and observe the changes in the value. Enjoy!
